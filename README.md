# Mutex-Example
Project created to practice: thread creation, using the Ti-RTOS, and using a mutex to coordinate the threadsâ€™ activities.

## Application Design Details
Created using the "Empty" example for the TM4C123GH6PM. 

This examples is the same as the "Empty (Minimal)" example except many
development and debug features are enabled. For example:
* Logging is enabled
* Assert checking is enabled
* Kernel Idle task
* Stack overflow checking
* Default kernel heap is present

Please refer to the "Memory Footprint Reduction" section in the TI-RTOS User
Guide (spruhd4.pdf) for a complete and detailed list of the differences
between the empty minimal and empty projects.
